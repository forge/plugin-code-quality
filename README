This plugin makes it easy to add code quality tools to your project. Currently only Findbugs and Checkstyle are supported, but support for other tools will be added soon.
Use as follows:

forge git-plugin https://github.com/forge/plugin-code-quality
codequality setup --tool FINDBUGS
codequality setup --tool CHECKSTYLE
